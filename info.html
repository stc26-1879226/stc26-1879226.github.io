						<p id="backgroundBody">Seattle has always been a city that is known for its restaurants and shopping districts. From small family 
							businesses to major corporations, Seattle is the single place you can find them all. </p>	

							<p id="observations">Observations</p>

							<p id="observationsBody">The area that we explored had businesses on every block, large and small. There were so many in fact
								 that there was no possible way we were going to be able to explore them all. There were plenty of major retail stores around 
								 the area: Nike, Nordstrom, The North Face, Sephora, Macy, etc. And even more amazing restaurants such as Din Tai Fung, Starbucks, 
								 and food trucks lining the streets. If you ever wanted to try something new, whether that is a new style or trying out new foods, 
								 Seattle is the place to visit. With hundreds of stores, I’m positive that you will find something that fits you.

						<p id="background">Background</p>

						<p id="backgroundBody">Seattle believe it or not, is the birthplace of the genre ‘Alternative Rock.’ The genre was popular during the
							 1970’s to the early 1990’s. Record label “Sub Pop” had a lot to getting alternative rock into the mainstream music. The label had
							  put out their own chart which was the gateway that allowed well known alternative rock groups fall into the mainstream. Some top 
							  groups whose origin started out here are Nirvana and Pearl Jam, while there were lesser-known groups such as The Walkabouts, Soundgarden,
							   Mudhoney, etc. Seattle also has a cultural theater icon. The theater is none other than the Cinerama which got started it 1963. 
							   The theater was thriving for the first few months before the decline in the 80’s and 90’s. It wasn’t until 1999 that the Cinerama
							    would reopen and become the staple spot for blockbuster-run movies, cult classics, and even film festivals.
						</p>

							<p id="observations">Observations</p>

							<p id="observationsBody">From what I observed, music isn’t the only thing that Seattle had considered art. The city had thought about
								 buildings as a type of public art. We had noticed common waiting areas were thought about as to how it would fit the buildings 
								 aesthetics to even the building itself being a big artwork such as our very own Washington State Convention Center. Though I do 
								 believe the most interesting building we saw would be the Amazon Spheres. The area is where Amazon employees go to do office work 
								 in a more natural environment, but nonetheless there are specific areas that are available to the public to explore.

						<p id="background">Background</p>

						<p id="backgroundBody">Westlake is one of the smallest neighborhoods in Seattle, only .15 miles, it is a small strip of land that 
							runs along the shores of Lake Union and home to about 1,700 people. Westlake is an important part of Seattle’s history because
							 it is linked to Seattle’s growth of coal and timber industries because they transported coal to ships on Elliot Bay which then
							  led to Seattle’s first railway.</p>

							<p id="observations">Observations</p>

							<p id="observationsBody">I noticed that the only places where there was a lot of technology was inside of buildings. There are a
								few outside of buildings, for example, clocks and digital billboards. It was different because when I did my research on technology
								it showed me places like the Amazon headquarters or Facebook in the area. Seeing a lot of homeless people really surprised me
								the most when I was visiting the area because I’ve seen them around before but I never imagined that there would be so many,
								it sucks that we can’t do anything to help them even if we really wanted to because of financial issues or other things that
								would prevent us from helping them.</p>

						<p id="background">Background</p>

						<p id="backgroundBody">Historically, Seattle has not been known for its expansive view of the sky or city blocks lined with greenery.
					   However, in recent times, the local government has made quite the effort to start improving community access to parks and greenery. 
					   There have always been plans to expand the skyview within the city, but only recently have plans finally manifested in visible change. 
					   See observations for more. </p>

							<p id="observations">Observations</p>

							<p id="observationsBody">Change has been noticeable, and the community has responded well to the change within the confines of the 
								Seattle city blocks. On most sidewalks you can look left and right and be pleasantly surprised to find trees and plants. Some 
								portions of the city have even been paved around a single, fully grown evergreen tree! City blocks feel wider and give more of
								 a view of the sky, allowing for a more open feel, and not often does it feel as though there’s buildings looming over you, not
								 claustrophobic in the slightest. Definitely feels like a relaxed city vibe, as opposed to jamming everything in like a pack of 
								 sardines.</p>
